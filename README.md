Then we integrated the Chatbot architecture with the Marketplace app in react. In the end i was working for the React App Team as a frontend developer.
  
### C# Software Engineer at Aurea Software (2016 - 2018)
  I worked in two teams, one with C# and other with Unity3D.
  The first was developing and application to automaticaly generate unit tests and integration tests. Each team member could do up to 30.000 lines of code coverage per week. Really helped to cover most use cases, but required regeneration with each major change in the code.
  Secondly, i worked with Unity3D developing a new type of visualization of Github Repositories for Management. All repositories showed up as buildings and the City is the organization. Crazy idea but worked really well with small organizations.
